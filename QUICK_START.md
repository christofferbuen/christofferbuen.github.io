- **Clear**: Use Ctrl+L shortcut instead of typing `clear`
- **Themes**: Experiment with different color schemes - they're all unique!
- **Settings**: Customize CRT effects in settings modal

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found?
- Type `help` to see all available commands
- Type `man command` for help on a specific command
- Check spelling (case-insensitive but must be complete)

### Files disappeared?
- Check if you're in the right directory with `pwd`
- Use `find` to search all files
- Browser cleared localStorage? Files would reset

### Effects too intense?
- Open settings with ‚öôÔ∏è button or Ctrl+Shift+S
- Adjust flicker intensity slider
- Toggle effects on/off

## Advanced Usage

### View command history
```
history               # Show all past commands
```

### Check environment
```
env                  # See all variables
```

### Manual pages
```
man pwd              # Help on pwd command
man ls               # Help on ls command
man cd               # Help on cd command
```

## Fun Commands

### Matrix effect (Easter egg)
```
matrix              # Cool green matrix animation
```

### System info
```
uname -a            # Fun system information
```
